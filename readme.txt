== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= There are many other bots, what about the? =
Well straight forward answer is that go Pro. You can track 50+ bots, crawlers, spiders etc and it has flexibility to add more.

In Pro you can deactivate what you don't want to track.

= How do I upgrade from Lite to Pro? =
Simple. First Deactivate your Lite version and activate your Pro version and that's pretty much it.

= Can I update Bot Info ? =
Well you can in Pro, but I would recommend not to touch data that comes with this plugin. You can however add your own bots, spiders etc and experiment with that data instead.
